This is the capstone to my flexbox course. In order to increase the challenge, I added in a set of scss variables to allows changes to the theme colors and also externalized the javascript, which was given to me as I have not learned javascript as of yet (As of 10/03/2022). The general idea of the content is a website about the impact of reading on peoples' lives. This was designed with a combination of CodePen and VSC. It is made to be opened by VSC hence the map file. Codepen was to help me understand the relationship between the html and the scss and how to insure proper communication. This entire repository was uplaoded by cmdline from VSC.
